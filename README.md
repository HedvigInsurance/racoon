# Racoon ü¶ù

Monorepo to for everything related to Hedvig.com.

## Why Racoon?

Raccoons can eat just about anything, making them ideal urban dwellers. They love big city life! Today there are 20 times more of them in cities compared to 70 years ago. They can now be found across the globe.

## Getting Started

### Install Node.js with `nvm`

1. Install `nvm` [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. `nvm install` (installs the node version specified in `.nvmrc`)
1. `nvm use` (use version from `.nvmrc`)

### Package manager

We use `yarn` as package manager. [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) installs the specified version defined in `package.json` so you do not need to install it yourself.

### Install project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HedvigInsurance/racoon
cd racoon
nvm use
yarn
```

### Development

#### Environment variables

Ask someone from the Web domain team to help you out :)

If you're already part of the Vercel-team you can run:

```sh
vercel --scope hedvig link --project hedvig-dot-com --yes
vercel env pull apps/store/.env.local
```

### If you're using VSCode

Follow [this guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks#vscode) to setup VS Code in order Yarn PnP and Typescript to work accordingly.
