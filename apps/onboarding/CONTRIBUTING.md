## `blurDataURL`

Some image component accept a `blurDataURL` prop. This is a [Next.js feature](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#blurdataurl) that enables you to show a placeholder image before the `src`image successfully loads.

You can generate a BlurHash string for a given image by uploading it to the [Blurha.sh](https://blurha.sh/) website.
